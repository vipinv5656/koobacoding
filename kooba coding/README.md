Kooba Backend Challenge 2024
===

You've made to the Kooba technical challenge... Nice one!

# Time limit
Please spend no more than 3-4 hours at a maximum on this task. If you don't get it finished within that time it's not a problem.

# Before you start
* Read through the brief below in detail and take a look at the HTML build by pulling down this repository to your local machine and opening homepage.html in a browser.
* Estimate how much time would be needed to complete the challenge. As mentioned above, if you don't think it's achievable within 3-4 hours above, that's fine.
* Make some notes about your planned approach to the task.
* Share your estimation and planned approach with me by email (thomas.davis@kooba.ie, christian.rochford@kooba.ie) before you start coding.

Pro tip: If you don't think you'll have enough time to complete all aspects of the build, consider prioritising the most critical elements!

# The brief

Integrate the static HTML page (homepage.html) within this repository into one of the following Content Management Systems:
* Expression Engine 7+ (https://expressionengine.com/)
* Craft CMS 4+ (https://craftcms.com/)

Note: do not install any default templates, the challenge templates should be integrated from scratch.

The page consists of a responsive listing of card elements, representing upcoming shows at an event venue.

These shows are grouped into three sections, which have already been made navigable via tabs:
* Just announced (Most recently added events)
* Upcoming (Events sorted by ascending order of date, soonest first)
* Featured (Events selected as 'Featured' items within the CMS)

Each of these sections/tabs should show a maximum of 6 cards.

Each show has a range of related data which need to be displayed within its cell. Cells show more data when hovered. You should explore the cells in the static HTML build to identify the required data fields.

Editors should have the ability to create, update and delete shows and their data via the CMS.

# Bonus functionality 
If you have some time left over you can take a look at the following items (these are not essential for your submission):
* Some events show a 'Remind Me' button if dates are not yet announced. The intended functionality here is to generate an ICS file.
* Each card should link to a dedicated event detail page.
* Automatically generated WebP versions of images delivered through ```<picture>``` tags. 
* 'View All Shows' button to go to full listing page which shows all events.

# Submission

When you're ready to deliver, please set up a repository on github or bitbucket, and share access with thomas.davis@kooba.ie, christian.rochford@kooba.ie.
Please setup this site on a domain of your choice and share the domain and the CMS login details for review in the browser.
